# T-skills Agent Guide

This file is the canonical agent guide for the T-skills repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, so Claude Code and Codex see identical content. Edit this file; do not edit `CLAUDE.md`.

## Project

T-skills is a skill collection for engineering workflows. The repository contains eight skills: `think`, `design`, `check`, `hunt`, `write`, `learn`, `read`, and `health`.

## Repository Map

- `VERSION` - single source of truth for the lock-step version. Every `SKILL.md` frontmatter, marketplace entry, README install URL, and installer `TSKILLS_REF` default must agree with this file.
- `skills/RESOLVER.md` - trigger and routing table for the skill set.
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` - individual skill entrypoints.
- `skills/*/agents/` - specialist reviewer or inspector prompts.
- `skills/*/references/` - supporting references loaded only when needed.
- `skills/*/scripts/` - deterministic helper scripts.
- `rules/` - shared writing and behavior rules used by install and validation flows. `rules/durable-context.md` is the shared Durable Context Preflight preamble; the six skills with optional memory context link to it from their own preflight section.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - **generated**. Edit `VERSION` or per-skill `SKILL.md` frontmatter and run `make regenerate`; never hand-edit.
- `packaging.allowlist` - default-deny list of paths that ship in `t-skills.zip`. New shippable assets must be added here explicitly; everything else is excluded.
- `.github/workflows/` - public test and release automation. `release.yml` runs `make test` before `make package` so the tagged commit is gated by the same suite as PRs.
- `scripts/build_metadata.py` - codegen for marketplace.json, README install URLs, and installer-script `TSKILLS_REF` defaults. Run via `make regenerate`; CI checks drift via `make verify-generated`.
- `scripts/verify_skills.py` - the only validator entrypoint. Covers frontmatter, references, marketplace, resolver, links, table pipes, trigger overlap, rule-file presence, README install string, English coaching guard, and AI-attribution leak detection.
- `scripts/package-skill.sh` + `scripts/packaging_filter.py` - build `dist/t-skills.zip` from `packaging.allowlist`.
- `scripts/setup-rule.sh` + `scripts/setup-statusline.sh` - public install helpers; `TSKILLS_REF` defaults are codegen-pinned to the current release tag.
- `Makefile` - smoke discovery and packaging entrypoints. Adding a `tests/test_<name>.sh` file is enough to create a `smoke-<name>` target automatically.
- `tests/test_*.sh` - one smoke per surface; sources `tests/test_helpers.sh` for tmpdir / repo-copy / stub-curl factories.

## Commands

```bash
make test             # verify-docs + verify-generated + verify-routing + verify-scripts + all smokes
make regenerate       # rewrite marketplace.json, README install URLs, installer TSKILLS_REF defaults
make verify-generated # drift check used by CI; non-zero if regenerate would change anything
make package          # build dist/t-skills.zip from packaging.allowlist
```

Run `make test` before meaningful changes to skill behavior, packaging, scripts, marketplace metadata, or anything generated. If you edited only frontmatter or VERSION, also run `make regenerate` and commit the resulting `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` / `README.md` / installer changes together with your source edits.

## Skill Design Rules

Before adding a capability, decide the layer deliberately:

| Question | Yes | No |
|---|---|---|
| Does the user need judgment, adaptation, or follow-up questions? | Skill | Script or rule |
| Does the same input always produce the same output? | Script or rule | Skill |
| Is it a lookup, list, status check, or invariant check? | Script or rule | Skill |
| Does behavior shift with conversation context? | Skill | Script or rule |

Examples: `verify_skills.py` is a script; `rules/english.md` and `rules/chinese.md` are rules; `/think`, `/hunt`, `/check`, and `/health` are skills.

- Put adaptive, judgment-heavy workflows in skills.
- Put deterministic checks, lookups, and table-driven validation in scripts.
- `rules/anti-patterns.md` owns cross-skill always-on behavioral guardrails (AI failure modes that apply regardless of active skill). Per-skill gotchas stay in each `skills/*/SKILL.md` Gotchas table; a gotcha belongs in `rules/anti-patterns.md` only when it applies identically across all eight skills.
- Before adding or changing an anti-pattern row, compare existing rows by failure mode. Merge duplicate concepts instead of adding near-synonyms, and keep row wording generic enough to ship outside this repo.
- Keep `skills/RESOLVER.md` in sync when a skill description, trigger, or scope changes.
- Keep each `description` concrete enough for automatic routing.
- Write skill entrypoints outcome-first: name the target result, what counts as done, which constraints and evidence matter, and what the final answer or artifact should look like. Keep detailed process in mode sections and references.
- Avoid broad skills that mix unrelated workflows.
- Eight skills is the hard cap. Do not propose a 9th skill or split an existing one. Behavior additions land in `references/`, `rules/`, `scripts/`, or `rules/anti-patterns.md`, not as a new skill.
- Keep generic programmer capabilities in T-skills. Project-specific constraints should be extracted from public repository context or user-provided task context.
- Treat `code-review` as an invocation alias for T-skills `check`, not as a separate generic skill.
- T-skills `check` must remain project-aware without depending on unpublished local files. It extracts commands, generated artifacts, risk areas, and release rules from the target diff, public docs, manifests, CI config, and user-provided context.
- Keep distribution files self-contained for Claude Desktop and plugin installs. The release ZIP may inline sub-skill bodies into a generated root `SKILL.md`; source-of-truth skill content remains under `skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- If a `templates/` directory is added, keep reusable public scaffolds there and include it in packaging/validation rules deliberately.
- Keep the README short: a new reader should understand T-skills in 30 seconds. Detailed rules belong in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `rules/*.md`, or this file. Do not stack promotional sections at the top.

## Adding Or Changing A Skill

Use this path for any new skill or meaningful behavior change:

1. Create or update `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; keep the description concrete, triggerable, and include a `Not for ...` exclusion. Frontmatter `metadata.version` must match the top-level `VERSION` file.
2. Update `skills/RESOLVER.md` routing rows so the new skill or changed scope is reachable; never hand-edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (run `make regenerate` instead).
3. Keep T-skills public: extract project-specific details from public repo context at runtime instead of hardcoding private paths, credentials, or one-machine workflow.
4. Put deterministic enforcement in `scripts/` or `rules/`; keep only adaptive judgment in the skill body.
5. If the new skill ships a new top-level asset (new dir under root, new helper script the user needs), add the path to `packaging.allowlist`. Default behavior is exclusion.
6. Run `make regenerate` after frontmatter / VERSION edits, then `make test` and `make package` before release handoff.

## Maintainability Invariants

- Prefer generation over drift lint when the same metadata appears in multiple distribution files. `VERSION` and `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter are the source of truth for generated marketplace and install metadata.
- Keep executable programs as real files, not heredocs inside shell scripts or Makefile recipes. Shell wrappers may delegate to Python helpers, but large logic belongs in importable `.py` files with `py_compile` coverage.
- Keep smoke tests in `tests/test_*.sh`; `Makefile` should discover and run them, not embed large test bodies.
- Avoid hidden runtime dependencies. If a script needs a non-stdlib Python package, external CLI, or network resolver, declare it in CI/docs and add a smoke test that fails without it.
- Installer scripts that fetch remote content must default to a release tag. Use `TSKILLS_REF=main` only as an explicit bleeding-edge override.
- One-off review reports, scorecards, or diagnostic snapshots do not belong in durable docs. Extract the stable rule into `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `rules/`, `skills/*/references/`, or a verifier script, then drop the report.
- Project case studies are inputs, not T-skills policy. Only promote the transferable workflow rule; keep project-specific commands, paths, release rituals, and safety constraints in that project's public context.
- Local-only instruction overlays are not durable source of truth. If a rule must guide future contributors or packaged agents, put it in tracked public docs or shipped skill/rule files.
- Local review and health checks must account for modified, staged, and untracked files. New helpers, tests, references, and packaging allowlists are part of the review surface before they are committed.

## Distribution Rules

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `skills/RESOLVER.md`, and every `skills/*/SKILL.md` must agree on skill names, descriptions, and source paths.
- `npx skills add tanglei168/T-skills` should install the eight direct coding skills by default. Do not add a source-root `SKILL.md`; it prevents nested skill discovery.
- Claude Desktop uses the release ZIP built by `scripts/package-skill.sh`.
- `scripts/package-skill.sh` builds a public archive with exactly one generated root `SKILL.md`; nested `skills/*/SKILL.md` files are inlined for packaged installs.
- Do not make packaged skills resolve scripts or references through personal home-directory caches or machine paths. Resolve relative to the installed T-skills directory.
- Rules under `rules/` are shared public behavior, not project-private memory.

## Verification

- Skill behavior changes: run `python3 scripts/verify_skills.py` and the relevant smoke target.
- Packaging changes: run `make package` and inspect the generated archive.
- Marketplace, resolver, or root dispatcher changes: run `python3 scripts/verify_skills.py` and confirm every marketplace source points at an existing skill directory.
- Non-trivial diffs: run the review workflow before release handoff.
- Documentation-only changes: check internal links and command names.

## Commit And Release

- Commit convention: `{type}: {description}` where type is `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, or `chore`.
- Keep commits atomic. A commit touching more than ~20 files should split into packaging / docs / scripts / per-skill units, unless every file is the same codegen output from `make regenerate`.
- Release tags use lowercase `v{version}`.
- Rebuild packaged artifacts before publishing release assets. Run `make package` before publishing; CI should upload the ZIP on published releases.
- After a GitHub release is published and assets are verified, add every positive release reaction with `gh api`: `+1`, `laugh`, `heart`, `hooray`, `rocket`, and `eyes`. Resolve the release id from the tag, POST each reaction to `repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/<id>/reactions`, then re-read reactions to confirm them.
- **Never add the `-1` or `confused` reactions**. Those are negative signals; adding them to one's own release reads as self-deprecation. Only the six positive reactions above.
